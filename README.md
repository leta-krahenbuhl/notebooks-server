## Developer installation guide

- Download both client and server side of the notebooks code from GitHub:
  - Front-end: https://github.com/leta-krahenbuhl/notebooks
  - Back-end: https://github.com/leta-krahenbuhl/notebooks-server
- Log in to MySQL (mysql -u root -p, then type in your password and hit enter)
- Set up a local MySQL database called 'notebooks'
- Server side:
  - npm install (to install any dependencies including knex and mysql2)
  - set up a local .env file with your environment variables (see env.sample file for reference)
  - npx knex migrate:latest (create the three database tables)
  - npx knex seed:run (to populate the database tables)
  - npm start (to start server, should be as a custom script in package.json)
- Client side:
  - npm install (to install any dependencies)
  - set up a local .env file with your environment variables (see env.sample file for reference)
  - npm start (to view react app in browser)

## Nice-to-haves / next steps

- This project is set up to be extended to incorporate mood trackers, habit trackers and journals as well
- Each notebook will eventually represent a year and contain all lists, trackers and journal entries from that year, sorted by date
- Responsive design
- Log-in functionality

## Key take-aways

- Coding takes time
- Error messages are my friends
- The same problem looks very different at 11:30pm and 11:30am
- If anything seems to complicated, break it down into smaller pieces
